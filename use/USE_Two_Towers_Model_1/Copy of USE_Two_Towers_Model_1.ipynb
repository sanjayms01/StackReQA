loop you pretty much have already. This just grabs the two numbers and interprets them as integers. After this line, nums = [1, 8] for your first line '1-8'. Next we add one to the the last element of the list, so nums = [1, 9] now. We do this because the range(a, b) builtin generates numbers from a to b-1.\n","Next we create a range that will generate the numbers that you want with range(*nums). The * in that statement unpacks the list into the two arguments that range() is expecting.\n","Finally we print all of the items in the range. Since my_range is now a generator, we need to unpack it to print, so we use a list comprehension to iterate over it and get all of the numbers.\n","------\n","You can use a short list comprehension to extract the numbers from a given line. Since the ranges you listed seem to be inclusive on both ends, we need to add one to end interval (j) below.\n","for line in myfile:\n","    i, j = [int(n) for n in line.split(\"-\")]\n","    for x in range(i, j + 1):\n","        # do things\n","\n","If you simply want to stick the two numbers in a range, here's an alternative:\n","range(*[int(n) for n in line.split(\"-\")])\n","\n","If you want to list out the numbers in the range, you need to wrap the expression in a list().\n","------\n","First, if you're in the mood for something hacky, IIRC, you can call copytree and pass move rather than copy2 as the copier, and it ends up moving all of the files to the right place, but on either Unix or Windows (I forget which) it leaves empty directories behind instead of nothing. But that's trivial to clean up:\n","shutil.copytree(src, dst, function=shutil.move)\n","shutil.rmtree(src)\n","\n","\n","If you don't want something hacky:\n","From your diagram, it seems like you just have 31 subdirectories all directly under the source directory, not nested underneath each other. So, trying to walk the whole hierarchy recursively with walk, and then trying to reassemble the paths properly, etc. is just making things more complicated, and probably even less efficient.\n","All you have to do is get those 31 directories, and move them. For example, using scandir:\n","for entry in os.scandir(src):\n","    if entry.is_dir():\n","        shutil.move(entry.path, dst)\n","\n","Or, if you have files as well as directories at the top level, it's even simpler:\n","for entry in os.scandir(src):\n","    shutil.move(entry.path, dst)\n","\n","If you're on an old version of Python that doesn't have scandir, you'll have to use listdir, but that's only a tiny bit more difficult:\n","for name in os.listdir(src):\n","    shutil.move(os.path.join(src, name), dst)\n","\n","------\n","Iterators in python can not be dynamically changed inside the for loop body. Modifying the current value does not affect what appears next in the iteration.\n","So if you want to print odd numbers, you should use built-in step size argument like this\n","l=[]\n","for i in range(1, 10, 2):\n","    l.append(i)\n","print(l)\n","\n","Here we are using step size of 2 to increment the iterable by 2 after every iteration.\n","------\n","def replacest1(string, st1, st2):\n","    return string.replace(st1, st2)\n","\n","Test:\n","replacest1(\"abcdefdcba\", \"c\", \"x\")\n","\n","results in:\n","\"abxdefdxba\"\n","\n","Test:\n","replacest1(\"yyyyzzzz\", \"c\", \"x\")\n","\n","results in:\n","\"yyyyzzzz\"\n","\n","\n","Or much much much much better:\n","\"abcdefdcba\".replace(\"c\", \"x\")\n","\n","Please note that the function defined above is a 1:1 correspondence to the function demanded by the question. It is not a good practice to use string as an identifier. I'd strongly recommend not to use such kind of identifier.\n","\n","A note: As the definition of such a function can be eliminated altogether as string.replace() still exists while it is deprecated the solution above will still contain the identifier string as used in the question. If the function couldn't be eliminated I'd use a different identifier here but as defining an own function isn't necessary at all anyway I let this identifier be as it is for now.\n","\n","Here is a variant of how to implement that without the usage of string.replace():\n","def replaceCharacters(inputString, findChar, replaceChar):\n","    assert isinstance(inputString, str)\n","    assert isinstance(findChar, str)\n","    assert len(findChar) == 1\n","    assert isinstance(replaceChar, str)\n","    assert len(replaceChar) == 1\n","\n","    buffer = \"\"\n","    for c in inputString:\n","        buffer += replaceChar if c == findChar else c\n","    return buffer\n","\n","A note: I prefer to use asserts in order to detect programming errors. If performance is not a big issue in your use case these asserts don't cause any trouble but prevent accidentally misusing a function like this: If you accidentally pass wrong parameters the asserts will fail and give you feedback immediately.\n","------\n","The line input(\"More?\") does not play any role in the flow of your program.\n","You can checkout the documentation for input function here https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input. But basically input function does 3 things:\n","\n","Print the prompt \"More?\"\n","Wait for user input\n","Return user input as string\n","\n","Maybe, you can rewrite the last line like below:\n","if input(\"More?\") == \"N\":\n","    return\n","\n","Edit: To address your question: How can the function print out all possible solutions?\n","I assume x = 0 at the left-most cell, x = 9 at right-most cells. y = 0 at top cell and y = 9 at bottom cell.\n","\n","The first loop is translated to scanning each column left to right\n","\n","The second loop is translated to scanning each cell in a column from top to bottom\n","\n","In each cell:\n","\n","If cell value is not set, check all possible values for the cell\n","\n","Try each possible value iteratively and call solve() again (1). The call to solve can either success, print board or fail and print nothing. In either case, the temporary value is cleared to try new value.\n","\n","\n","If no possible value found => terminate (2)\n","\n","\n","If cell value is set => ignore and continue with new cell\n","\n","\n","\n","Finally, each call to solve may success and print the board or terminate at (2)\n","\n","\n","Notice that after each call to solve at (1), cell value is always reset\n","==> Basically, the \"original\" solve function loop over all empty cells try each possible value while other cells unchanged. Then it clone itself, send the clone back to the start of the table to fill other empty cells. The clone now see the table with 1 less empty cells compared to the original. The clone now again fill 1 empty cell, clone itself and send the clone of clone back to the start of table. The clone of clone now see the table with 2 less empty cells compared to the original.\n","If you continue with this line of thought, you can see the algorithm here try every possible values (i.e brute-force) ==> No wonder that it can print out all solutions.\n","------\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Zis26dajZqX2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1618104109298,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3455,"user":{"displayName":"Sanjay
